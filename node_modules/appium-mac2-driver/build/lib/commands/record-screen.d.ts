/**
 * Record the display in background while the automated test is running.
 * This method requires FFMPEG (https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) to be installed
 * and present in PATH. Also, the Appium process must be allowed to access screen recording
 * in System Preferences->Security & Privacy->Screen Recording.
 * The resulting video uses H264 codec and is ready to be played by media players built-in into web browsers.
 *
 * @param deviceId - Screen device index to use for the recording.
 *                        The list of available devices could be retrieved using
 *                       `ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i` command.
 * @param timeLimit - The maximum recording time, in seconds. The default
 *                        value is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
 * @param videoFilter - The video filter spec to apply for ffmpeg.
 *                 See https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/FilteringGuide for more details on the possible values.
 *                 Example: Set it to `scale=ifnot(gte(iw\,1024)\,iw\,1024):-2` in order to limit the video width
 *                 to 1024px. The height will be adjusted automatically to match the actual ratio.
 * @param fps - The count of frames per second in the resulting video.
 *                        The greater fps it has the bigger file size is. 15 by default.
 * @param preset - One of the supported encoding presets. A preset is a collection of options that will provide a
 *         certain encoding speed to compression ratio.
 *         A slower preset will provide better compression (compression is quality per filesize).
 *         This means that, for example, if you target a certain file size or constant bit rate, you will
 *         achieve better quality with a slower preset. Read https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264 for more details.
 *         `veryfast` by default
 * @param captureCursor - Whether to capture the mouse cursor while recording the screen.
 *                  False by default
 * @param captureClicks - Whether to capture mouse clicks while recording the screen.
 *                  False by default.
 * @param forceRestart - Whether to ignore the call if a screen recording is currently running
 *                (`false`) or to start a new recording immediately and terminate the existing one
 *                if running (`true`). The default value is `true`.
 * @throws {Error} If screen recording has failed to start or is not supported on the device under test.

/**
 * Stop recording the screen.
 * If no screen recording has been started before then the method returns an empty string.
 *
 * @param remotePath - The path to the remote location, where the resulting video should be uploaded.
 *                              The following protocols are supported: http/https, ftp.
 *                              Null or empty string value (the default setting) means the content of resulting
 *                              file should be encoded as Base64 and passed as the endpoint response value.
 *                              An exception will be thrown if the generated media file is too big to
 *                              fit into the available process memory.
 * @param user - The name of the user for the remote authentication.
 * @param pass - The password for the remote authentication.
 * @param method - The http multipart upload method name. The 'PUT' one is used by default.
 * @param headers - Additional headers mapping for multipart http(s) uploads
 * @param fileFieldName - The name of the form field, where the file content BLOB should
 *                                 be stored for http(s) uploads
 * @param formFields - Additional form fields for multipart http(s) uploads
 * @returns Base64-encoded content of the recorded media file if 'remotePath'
 * parameter is falsy or an empty string.
 * @throws {Error} If there was an error while getting the name of a media file
